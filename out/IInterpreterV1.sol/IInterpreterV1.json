The security model of an interpreter is that it MUST be resilient to malicious expressions even if they dispatch arbitrary internal function pointers during an eval. The interpreter MAY return garbage or exhibit undefined behaviour or error during an eval, _provided that no state changes are persisted_ e.g. in storage, such that only the caller that specifies the malicious expression can be negatively impacted by the result. In turn, the caller must guard itself against arbitrarily corrupt/malicious reverts and return values from any interpreter that it requests an expression from. And so on and so forth up to the externally owned account (EOA) who signs the transaction and agrees to a specific combination of contracts, expressions and interpreters, who can presumably make an informed decision about which ones to trust to get the job done. The state changes for an interpreter are expected to be produces by an `eval` and passed to the `IInterpreterStoreV1` returned by the eval, as-is by the caller, after the caller has had an opportunity to apply their own intermediate logic such as reentrancy defenses against malicious interpreters. The interpreter is free to structure the state changes however it wants but MUST guard against the calling contract corrupting the changes between `eval` and `set`. For example a store could sandbox storage writes per-caller so that a malicious caller can only damage their own state changes, while honest callers respect, benefit from and are protected by the interpreter store's state change handling. The two step eval-state model allows eval to be read-only which provides security guarantees for the caller such as no stateful reentrancy, either from the interpreter or some contract interface used by some word, while still allowing for storage writes. As the storage writes happen on the interpreter rather than the caller (c.f. delegate call) the caller DOES NOT need to trust the interpreter, which allows for permissionless selection of interpreters by end users. Delegate call always implies an admin key on the caller because the delegatee contract can write arbitrarily to the state of the delegator, which severely limits the generality of contract composition.\",\"version\":1},\"userdoc\":{\"kind\":\"user\",\"methods\":{\"eval(address,uint256,uint256,uint256[][])\":{\"notice\":\"The raison d'etre for an interpreter.
